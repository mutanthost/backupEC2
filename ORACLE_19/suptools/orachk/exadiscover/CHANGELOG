                CHANGELOG

   Version 1.5

   Version 1.5.6

************************************************
Version 1.5.6
 - Fixed following bug:
	Exachk has problem running under Enterprise Manager. The permission of copied .sql files at f_global_init() is not correctly set for Enterprise Manager environment. Added permissions to ${SYS_TMP_DIR}/*.sql
 
Version 1.5.5
 - Fixed following bug:
	Unset $TMPDIR in f_global_init() and export $TMPDIR in f_global_clean() to prevent $TMPDIR in exachk to interfere with running exadiscover and generating exachk_exalogic.conf in exachk context

Version 1.5.4
 - Fixed following bug:
	Hide the Spine information for now by changing the keywords in list_assets.sql and list_all_ip_vars.sql for spine information
        For Echo system, output 127.0.0.1 for db related entries
        Capturing correct leaf switch information from control db in list_assets.sql and list_all_ip_vars.sql and list_all_ips.sql as keywords for switches could be different in various setups. Now the query pattern is %InfiniBand Switch%GW or %InfiniBand Gateway Switch%. The fix in 1.5.3 will capture spine switch information, thus the change of the keywords from 1.5.3.

Version 1.5.3
 - Fixed following bug:
        Capturing correct leaf switch information from control db in list_assets.sql and list_all_ip_vars.sql as keywords for switches could be different in various setups. Now the query pattern is %InfiniBand%Switch%.
